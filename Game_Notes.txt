TODO:
    * Figure out rounding issue with doubles
    * Have rose only appear if there's a quantity...
    * Random events
    * Consider not having flower objects own their quantity - maybe some sort of inventory-like system
    * Change the "Sell" from market for flowers to only be listed in the inverntory
    * Maybe handle user input in a better way? Like, a helper function/lib/class?
